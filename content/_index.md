# Hello, Iâ€™m Mohammed El-Mustafa Ahmed (zikkas).

I'm a Mathematician and Backend Engineer, passionate about computing, optimisation, and building high-performance and efficient systems. I love exploring new topics, connecting ideas across disciplines, and uncovering unexpected solutions through creative thinking.

My work focuses on building scalable, reliable systems that perform under pressure - whether that means re-architecting backend infrastructures, optimising algorithms, or fine-tuning deployment pipelines. I enjoy blending mathematical precision with engineering creativity, always aiming to make systems that work and work beautifully.

Beyond engineering, I have a lifelong love for mathematics - from theoretical models and optimisation problems to the elegance of proofs, abstractions, and applied techniques. I believe that strong foundations, curiosity, and a bit of creativity and randomness in linking everything together are the keys to discovering meaningful and innovative solutions.

I'm always excited to dive into new challenges, learn new tools, and push the limits of what technology and mathematics can achieve together.

If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or chat about tech and mathematics, feel free to [reach out!](/contact)
